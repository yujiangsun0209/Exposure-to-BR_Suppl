                In this task, each of you will be paired with another different player as your counterpart. You will not be told who
                your counterpart is either during or after the experiment, and also, your counterpart will not be told who you
                are either during or after the experiment. One of you will be randomly assigned as Participant 1, and the other as
                Participant 2. Before making a decision, you will learn your role.

                The task is conducted as follows: an additional wealth of {{endowment}} has been provisionally allocated
                to each pair of players, and Participant 1 can decide how to split these {{endowment}} between herself or
                himself and Participant 2. To do this, Participant 1 must decide how much she or he would like to send to
                Participant 2.
