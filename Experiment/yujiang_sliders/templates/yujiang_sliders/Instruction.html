            In Task 1, you are asked to finish a series of positioning tasks.
            Specifically, you will be given 20 sets of numbers and sliders,
            and you need to use your mouse to click and drag the slider to precisely the point indicated by the given number in bold.
            Once you move the slider, instant feedback will appear below the slider bar that you are working on.
            Make sure the feedback number matches the given number in bold.
            Once it is done, please move to the next slider.

            You will be given 20 pairs of numbers and sliders divided into two pages (10 pairs on each page).
            <b>The goal is to position at least {{requirement}} sliders in total correctly, within {{time_given}} minutes.</b>
            Only those who accomplish this task will be rewarded {{ flat }} at the beginning of Task 2.
            However, those who fail this task are not allowed to continue with the rest parts (i.e., Part 2 and 3),
            and only a minimal show-up fee of {{ show_up }} will be granted to them.
